  All Ethoren could do was stand there, mouth agape. The dragon didn’t notice him. Instead, it stood waiting, Ethroen assumed, for him. He was standing half hidden behind a tree only 30 yards from the dragon. He could see past the destroyed wall the black bodies of people and destroyed buildings. The only thing left standing was the vendor’s stand.

</p>
<p>
Ethoren cautiously walked up to the dragon. The dragon turned its head and looked into Ethoren’s eyes. He wanted to look away, but the dragon wouldn’t let him, as if by some unknown force, locking its eyes on his own. Finally, after minutes, it took its eyes off Ethoren and onto a pile of things on the ground in front of it that Ethoren hadn’t noticed before. The dragon scooped up the pile with its claws and tossed it to Ethoren. In the pile was a bow, a belt, and a large pack.

</p>
<p>
  	“Ethoren, I have destroyed the city in search of the man who attempted to harm you. I have left him for you to do as you please with him.” Ethoren did nothing as he realized that the dragon was not speaking through his mouth, but through his mind. It was as if they were his own thoughts, but he wasn’t thinking them. He didn’t know what to do, so he turned and ran. He sprinted as fast and as far as he could, not stopping even for a breath or a drink of water. Finally, after what seemed like hours, he stopped and sat, unable to comprehend what had just occurred.

</p>
	“This is a dream, Ethoren, just a dream. There is not a dragon that just destroyed a city.” Ethoren attempted to convince himself. It couldn’t be real! Dragons had been extinct for decades. There was no way this was actually happening. The other appearance must have been a dream too.

<p>
  	Nevertheless, despite how much he wished it wasn’t happening, it was more than real. Not a long time later, Ethoren fell asleep. His dreams were of the city being ravaged by the dragon. He could hear the screams of the people in terror and the building being torn apart. The smell of smoke and fire was vivid, the screams of people burning, horrendous.

</p>
<p>
	Ethoren awoke with a jolt. He remembered the dream and screamed. It took him longer than a moment to realize he was back at his camp and thought all was normal, that the dragon didn’t actually exist. He stood up and turned his head toward his fire, not noticing that it shouldn’t be lit. He walked over to it and found his bow lying near it. He picked it up and started off into the forest when the thought occurred to him, “why is the fire lit? And why am I at my camp? I should be in Taverston.“

</p>
<p>
  	It was then that it hit him. All wasn’t normal, what he had taken for a dream was real. The dragon was real, and it had destroyed Taverston and killed all those innocent people. That must have been how he had gotten back to his camp, the dragon carried him. But where was it now? Ethoren panicked and ran back to the campsite.

</p>

<p>
  	Yet after all it had done, Ethoren still couldn’t hate it. He knew he should, and he wanted to, but he just couldn’t. He still felt grateful. Obviously it loved him enough to do all of this for him, even though the deeds were terrible. Ethoren was almost worried that the dragon was gone, and not for his own sake, for the sake of the dragon, who, Ethoren thought now, he should probably call by its name, Esmul, and what could have happened to it. He was nearly begging the gods that Esmul be okay. He didn’t notice, or ignored his feelings.

</p>

<p>
	When Ethoren arrived back at his camp, nearly two minutes later, there was still no dragon. Where could he be; nothing terrible could have happened to one so mighty. After pacing the camp for several minutes, he heard a roar coming from the forest. Along with the roar he heard a squeal. Moments later, a dragon appeared in the sky, a boar trapped between its two mighty jaws.
  
</p>
<p>
  	Ethoren gasped. Esmul descended, flying in small circles aimed slightly downwards. As he came down, he spoke to Ethoren. “I have hunted for you. I ate earlier. This should last long enough, unless of course I eat it.” Esmul laughed, the laugh sounding like a growl and a roar mixed.

</p>
<p>
	Ethoren’s mind jumped to the vendor. What had happened to him? Was he dead, had Esmul killed him? He waited for the dust to settle from Esmul’s landing before asking “What has happened to the vendor? Where is he?” Ethoren Asked Esmul, ”Did you kill him?” 

</p>
<p>
	“No. He is alive. He is behind a tree surrounding our camp. I forget where.” Esmul replied.

</p>
<p>
	“What direction? Wait, did you say our camp? This is mine, I barely know you! The only reason I will put up with you, is because you could kill me in half a second!” Ethoren was near screaming. He realized that he probably shouldn’t have yelled at a dragon. As he stated in his fit, Esmul could kill him in half a second. He looked down and hoped the worst would not happen. 

</p>
<p>
	“I shall not make the mistake again. I apologize. He is to the north, I believe.” Esmul spoke calm as ever. He had apologized to Ethoren. He couldn’t believe it. He looked up at the majestic creature. It was without doubt the most powerful animal he’d ever seen. Yet it had just apologized to him. Before that, he saved his life and brought him food, But why? Etheron was greatly Muddled, a thousand questions whirling around in his mind.

</p>
<p>
Why had the dragon saved him? Ethoren did not  see himself as someone worth saving, especially by a dragon. There must be a reason, but what? He would ask him after he found the vendor. He should probably start looking. The northern side, had Esmul said? Yes, that's right. 

</p>
<p>
As he searched, he pondered more. Where did the dragon come from? He couldn’t have just appeared out of nowhere. Dragons were supposed to be extinct. How could Esmul possibly be here? If they weren’t actually extinct, then why hadn't Ethoren heard of others ravaging cities like Esmul had? 

</p>
<p>
He found the vendor, not far from his camp, behind a tree like Esmul said. He was lying on the ground, either unconscious or asleep. He hoped he was asleep and nothing bad had happened to him. He dragged him back near his bed and set him on it.  As he put him on the bed, he was able to get a good look at him. He was an old man, with a bit of flesh on the side. His hair was completely grayed over and his beard and mustache looked as if they hadn’t been cut in a year.

</p>
  <p>
Ethoren would wait for him to wake. In the meantime, he would ask Esmul his questions. “Why did you save me? What’s so special about me? And you’re supposed to be extinct! How are you here?” Ethoren asked, a hint of accusation in his voice.

</p>
  <p>
“You think dragons are extinct? Maybe they are. I haven’t met any others. And what is special about you? Didn’t you feel a connection when we first met?” Esmul Replied.

</p>
  <p>
	“I did feel a connection, but that doesn’t explain my question! What is so special about me?” Ethoren was getting frustrated with the dragon. He was constantly doing weird things. 

</p>
  <p>
	“I know not. All I know is that my instinct is to protect you.” Ethoren had had enough. He stormed off to his bedside where the vendor was, as the dragon flew off to sit by the fire, where it wasn’t visible from the bedside. He didn’t feel like waiting. He would just wake him up. He grabbed his shoulders and shook him.

</p>
  <p>
	He awoke, groggy and tired. He curled into a ball and shook, sobbing silently. Ethoren felt bad for the man. He must have thought he was still within the dragon's power. 

</p>
  <p>
”Vendor?” Ethoren asked, not knowing what else to do. He waited to see if the man would calm down. After a few long moments passed, the vendor stopped shaking and spoke. 

</p>
  <p>
“Who are you? Last I remember I was being attacked by a dragon.” A scowl touched his face. “I know you! You’re the thief that stole my sword!”

</p>
  <p>
“I went into town to return it, but there was no town. I’m sorry.”  

</p>
  <p>
“Ah well, it doesn’t matter anymore anyway. My whole livelihood was destroyed by the beast. Wait, w-where is it?” The vendor's face grew a look of terror.

</p>
  <p>
 Etheron took a moment then replied “The dragon won’t hurt you anymore. It’s gone.” Of course, though, he wasn’t really gone, just out of sight. “What shall I call you, sir?”

</p>
  <p>
“Thank the lord” the vendor said, more to himself. “My name? It doesn't matter, I have no name, no work, and no home, but if you must know, it’s Sterion”

</p>
  <p>
“Well then, Sterion, I guess I might as well return the sword.”

</p>
  <p>
“Ah, just keep it. I’ve no use for it anyway. I’m an old man, and I don't even know how to use a sword. I was born of nobles. I didn’t need to learn sword fighting, I always had guards with me.”

</p>
  <p>
“Are you sure? It’s still yours after all.”

</p>
  <p>
“Yes I’m sure.” Sterion snapped. Ethoren could tell he would be quite irritating at times. That is, if he stuck around. Ethoren wasn’t sure if he wanted to make him leave or not. Esmul sensed his concerns and spoke up.

</p>
  <p>
“I think you should keep him.”   
</p>
  <p>
“Keep him? What is he, a pet? And did I ask your opinion? No. How do you even know what I’m thinking? Why won’t you leave me alone? Just go away already.” Ethoren had had enough of him. Why wouldn’t he leave him alone? He just wished he would go away. He wished all this had never happened.

</p>
  <p>
“Who are you talking to?” Sterion demanded.

</p>
  <p>
“I’m just talking to myself. Anyway, it doesn’t concern you.” Ethoren replied. Sterion didn’t look convinced, but he backed off anyway.

</p>
  <p>
Again, Esmul sensed Ethoren’s feelings and said, “You want me gone? Fine. I’ll leave.” Without another word, Esmul flew away. Ethoren breathed a sigh of relief, but was surprised to find that a curtain of guilt had wrapped itself around him. He pushed it out of his mind, though. He wouldn’t let himself feel bad for something that murdered an entire city; that was an unforgivable offense.
