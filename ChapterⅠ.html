  Ethoren woke up in the dirt, nothing but a sword lying by his side. 
He wore clothes with itchy cloth that felt like thick string just thrown together. 
He was covered in dirt and grime and was soaking from his feet to his chest. 
His hazel hair looked jet-black, covered in who knows what. His emerald green eyes felt like they had salt poured on them. 
His long limbs were sunburnt and felt like they were on fire. His whole body ached from soreness and exhaustion.
</p>
<p>
  The last thing Ethoren remembered was being chased down by the Uixear, hulking humanoids with a pure white skin, long claw-like fingernails, 
and sharp hair similar to a porcupine. Their teeth were sharpened like a dagger. 
Ethoren had stolen a precious sword from a renowned trinkets trader in the town of Taverston. 
Though he never got caught stealing it, an associate of the man noticed it while walking past on the street. 
He thought nothing of it, for it was common for nobles to send out servants to buy things for them, until he asked the vendor who he 
had sold it to. Of course the vendor was alerted by this and the man described Ethoren as the Uixear were sent out to take care of it. 
The Uixear tracked down Ethoren and found him at a camp nearly four miles out of town. Of course, Ethoren made a run for it, 
but no matter how he racked his brain, he couldn’t remember anything more. 
</p>
<p>
  After lying in the dirt for a few more minutes, he finally got up. All of his possessions were gone as well, all except the sword. Ethoren didn’t understand it, and didn’t want to. It was curious that the Uixear didn’t take the sword. The vendor would surely be mad. That was only what he thought though, until he saw all three of the Uixear who were chasing him. They were sprawled out on the ground like he had been, but instead of waking up, they were dead. Blood was pouring out of deep gashes, burns were still hot, at least a third of their bones broken, but most terrifying of all, there were chunks missing where bite marks were. Bite marks big enough that they could only be left by one creature, something that Ethoren had only heard of.

</p>
<p>
The bites were from a dragon, a fabled creature that many thought went extinct decades ago. Ethoren looked around for some sign, unable to fathom that he had been the sole survivor of a dragon attack. The only thing he saw was the bodies. That was until he looked up. A dragon circling overhead thousands of feet in the air.
</p>
<p>
Even though he knew he shouldn’t, Ethoren felt gratitude toward the beast. It had killed the Uixear who were coming after him and left him with only a few scrapes and bruises. He marveled at the sight of the dragon. He knew he should hate it for the evils it had just done, and had probably done in the past, but he couldn’t. He felt a certain connection towards it and felt sure it had toward him too. That must have been why it hadn’t killed him.

</p>
<p>
The dragon was emerald in color and about as wide as a catapult and as long as a trebuchet. It had ivory spikes running down it’s back and gleaming white teeth. It’s eyes were emerald as well. It’s talons were caked in the clear blood of the Uixear and it’s long tail whipped around acting as a balance for the enormous weight of its body. The thin membrane of its wings was running with visibly blue veins. There was a small rip on it’s left wing dripping with blood. It made Ethoren furious to see such a majestic creature bleeding.

</p>
<p>
“Ethoren, I am Esmul,” The dragon spoke in a soft growl, with a deep yet gentle voice. The dragon spoke more words, but after they were spoken, Ethoren’s memory of them was gone, instantly. He didn’t know what to think. The dragon had actually spoken to him! He knew that this was no ordinary occurrence. It was surely a great honor.
</p>
<p>
“H-how do you know my name?” Ethoren spoke in a hoarse voice, but before he could finish, Esmul was flying away. The whole event just left Ethoren even more confused than ever. He still had the sword, but now he felt guilty about having it. He decided that he would give it back when he went into Taverston again. The sword had an emerald green blade with an emerald on the bottom of the hilt, it’s hilt was a silver handle with notches going up and down, and it was wrapped in a dark leather. The hand guard was silver and curving upwards, getting thinner as it went.

</p>
<p>
Eventually, Ethoren got tired of standing around the mess. He started walking in the direction of the town, but veering off toward his camp. After all, the vendor would have definitely reported the theft to the guards and they would be watching for him. He would have to go back another time. When he arrived at the camp, he was ravenous, for who knew how long he had been unconscious. He greedily devoured whatever food he could get without cooking.

</p>
<p>
After a few weeks in his camp, his food was running low, and he had no bow to hunt with. He would have to go into town and hope that the vendor had forgotten about him. He decided he would go tomorrow. After all, it might take them tomorrow to forget him. He had to be as safe as possible.

</p>
<p>
The next day, he walked the 4 miles to town, sword in tow. When he arrived, the most unexpected thing happened. He came to find not a town, but the charred remains of a town. Even more surprising than that, though, was an emerald dragon standing in front of the crumpled gate. In the dragon’s mouth, held not the most gently, but not bleeding, was the unconscious, battered vendor he had stolen from.
