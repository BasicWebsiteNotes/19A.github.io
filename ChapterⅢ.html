  Ethoren turned and looked at Sterion. His face was horrified.“D-did you just see it? It just flew away. It wasn’t gone! You lied! You told me he was gone! Wait.. That’s who you were talking to!” Sterion exclaimed. 

</p>
<p>
  “I haven’t a clue what you are talking about.” Ethoren replied in a calm voice.

</p>
<p>
  “Yes you do. Don’t lie to me.” Sterion growled. He would have to get rid of this man, he could spread rumors about Esmul and Ethoren working with the dragon. How he would get rid of him, he didn’t know. For a second he considered killing him, but then cast it away. He wasn’t a murderer. Maybe he could threaten him, that could work. He decided he would go with that.

</p>
  <p>
  “Fine, I do, but if you mention a single word of this to anyone, I will send my dragon to kill you. He has instincts that will tell when someone is talking about him, so don't go whispering anything to any guards.” Ethoren growled back. Sterion’s expression was one of terror.
